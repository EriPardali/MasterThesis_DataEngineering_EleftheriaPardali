# Chapter 2 – Literature Review

This folder contains the finalized version of the literature review for the thesis:
**“End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline for Loan Portfolio Monitoring and KPI Calculation with API Exposure.”**

## Scope
The review is structured around five core KPIs:
1. **Default Rate**
2. **Average Loan Amount**
3. **Average Interest Rate**
4. **Portfolio Growth**
5. **Loan Distribution by Grade**

## Deliverables
- `Literature_Review.docx` – finalized academic chapter (KPI → Dataset → Results).
- (Optional) `Literature_Review_Summary_Table.xlsx` – summary of papers with KPIs, datasets, and results.

## Notes
This chapter forms the theoretical foundation that links directly to the empirical pipeline (ETL, KPI calculation, API exposure).
